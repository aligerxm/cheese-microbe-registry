# *Penicillium camemberti* strain IMC-F01

## Basic Information
- **Strain ID**: IMC-F01
- **Species**: *Penicillium camemberti*
- **Source Cheese**: Camembert sample from Normandy, France
- **Isolation Date**: 2024-03-15
- **Isolated By**: Dr. Jane Smith, IMC Lab
- **Current Storage**: -80°C freezer, cryovial box #5, position A3
- **Viability Status**: Active, regular subculturing every 3 months

## Growth Characteristics
- **Temperature Range**: 10–25°C
- **Optimal Temperature**: 18–22°C
- **pH Range**: 4.5–5.5
- **Oxygen Requirement**: Aerobic
- **Preferred Media**: Malt Extract Agar (MEA), Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)
- **Colony Morphology**: White to greyish mycelium, turning blue‑green with sporulation after 5–7 days.
- **Growth Rate**: Moderate (colony diameter ≈ 3 cm after 7 days at 20°C)
- **Relative Humidity Preference**: 85–95% (optimal for sporulation)

## Genomic Data
- **Marker Gene**: ITS region
- **GenBank Accession**: OR123456
- **Sequencing Platform**: Illumina MiSeq, paired‑end 2×300 bp
- **Coverage**: 100×
- **Raw Data**: [SRA accession SRX1234567](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX1234567)

## Ecological & Interaction Notes
### Antagonistic Effects
- Strong inhibition of *Geotrichum candidum* in dual‑culture assays on PDA.
- Production of mycophenolic acid (detected by LC‑MS) suppresses bacterial growth (tested against *Listeria innocua*).

### Synergistic Relationships
- Co‑cultivation with *Lactococcus lactis* enhances rind formation in a laboratory Camembert model.
- Compatible with *Debaryomyces hansenii*; no visible antagonism observed on cheese‑based medium.

### Secondary Metabolites
- **Mycophenolic acid**: antifungal/antibacterial activity, likely responsible for inhibition of competing fungi.
- **Cyclopiazonic acid**: trace amounts detected; role in cheese ripening unclear.

## Laboratory Handling
- **Subculturing Interval**: Every 3 months on MEA slants.
- **Long‑term Preservation**: Cryopreservation in 15% glycerol at ‑80°C.
- **Working Stock**: Maintained on PDA plates at 4°C for up to 4 weeks.

## Experimental Observations
- Used in cheese‑ripening trials; contributes to typical Camembert rind texture and aroma.
- Shows consistent sporulation under 85‑95% relative humidity at 18°C.
- Sensitive to low humidity (<80%); mycelial growth slows and sporulation is reduced.
